TMK with support for the Zenith Z-150
=====================================

This repo adds support for the Zenith Z-150 that speaks an "XT-like" protocol but requires the RST line and a few other protocol changes.  The code reportedly works very well on multiple Z-150 boards, including mine.  No keystrokes are dropped.

I'll post more documentation here soon.  For now, grab the pre-compiled .hex file here (compiled for the Teensy 2.0), or build from source following the instructions for TMK.  

For TMK, the latest source code is available here: <http://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard>
